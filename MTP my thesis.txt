when I say power you probably think of a power outlet but the fact is batteries were used long before electrical grids or generators were in use the term battery was first used in 1749 by Benjamin Franklin to describe a set of capacitors he'd wired in series in order to produce a higher voltage he was using the word in the sense of a set of Units connected together in series but eventually caught on so well that nowadays we use the term battery to describe even a single power cell of course Franklin's capacitors are not batteries in the modern sense we define a battery as a container consisting of one or more cells in which chemical energy is converted into electricity and use as a source of power it would be another 11 years before someone used a chemical and reaction to reliably produce electricity in 1800 Alessandro Volta stacked copper and zinc disks on top of one another separated by pieces of cloth soaked in salt water he called this a voltaic pile and it was the first source of relatively reliable continuous electricity in convenient pile form and this is considered the first definitive battery these zinc disks served as a nose copper as cathodes and the salt water was an electrolyte with these simple materials we can easily create our own voltaic pile let's start by making a single voltaic cell and a beaker the beaker cell produces 0.796 volts now I'll build a bunch of cells together as a voltaic pile using these cardboard squares which have argument soaked in the salt water it's not sturdy by any means but this leaning tower of Volta produces enough power to light a five-millimeter blue LED and for the record that is nine cells in the pile producing 6.33 volts not long after the voltaic pile was created william Cruikshank came along and improved the design by laying it on its side in a slotted box this helped prevent the electrolyte from leaking and causing shortness between plates and it was known appropriately enough as a trough of battery but moving away from piles and troughs in 1836 John Frederick Daniel pushed the battery further with his Daniel cell the Daniel cell's defining feature was his use of a porous barrier between two different electrolyte solutions in this example we see the copper cathode sitting inside of a porous earthenware pot filled with copper sulfate this pot is then submerged inside of a container filled with zinc sulfate and encircled by the zinc anode the poorest earthenware allows ions to pass between the electrolytes but hydrogen bubbles are prevented from forming this greatly increased the cell's lifespan when compared to a voltaic pile the Daniell cell wasn't perfect but it's improved reliability made it suitable for widespread use in fact a standard for one volt is based on the output of long Daniell cell all of the batteries we've talked about up until now would be considered primary which means once their chemical reactions are depleted that's it they need to be replaced now a secondary battery can be recharged multiple times and used again without being replaced which is a good thing in 1859 French physicist Gastelum plonked created the first rechargeable battery using a LED anode and a lead dioxide cathode immersed in sulfuric acid the chemical reactions inside plants led acid cell could be reversed by passing a reverse current through it a pretty amazing feature but its weight and size made it impractical for most uses still it was suitable for some things in fact let acid cells are still used in cars today so far all of these early batteries have used liquid electrolytes which pose pretty obvious challenges to portability but in 1886 Carl Gastner created the first dry cell battery using an electrolyte paste composed of ammonium chloride and plaster of Paris because it isn't spill and could be used in any orientation the zinc carbon cell opened the gates to many new portable uses such as flashlights the zinc-carbon cell would eventually be refined by the national carbon company and evolved into our modern alkaline battery you can easily see how little the design has changed over the years just a bit of help from a hacksaw it's densely packed but all the elements are still here a carbon cathode down the center a thin shell of zinc serving as the anode and a thick pasty black electrolyte of course more and more nowadays when we think battery is we think lithium in fact you probably carry around a lithium battery every day in your pocket because of its low density and high electrical potential lithium has long been considered an ideal material for use in batteries but it wasn't till the 1970s that the first primary lithium cells were made widely available further developments from researchers around the globe led to the release of a lithium ion battery in 1991 and later the lithium polymer battery in 1997 the major difference between lithium ion and lithium polymer is in the electrolyte a micro porous electrolyte used in lithium polymer batteries means they can deliver the same power as lithium ions but in a lighter flexible package otherwise the chemistry's are the same inside of a lithium-ion cell you'll find layers of anode usually composed of carbon cathode of metal oxide and an electrolyte containing a lithium salt so ultimately batteries come down to chemistry and although you'll hear about revolutionary changes being made to battery design the basics remain the same anode cathode and electrolyte if anything major changes I'll let you know
